# ARsenic Automated Tests

ARsenic automated testing is done through the **Unity Testing Framework**.
Tests are defined for each assembly definition, which were discussed in the main `README.md` file found in the root directory.

Tests can be manually ran through the Unity Test Runner.
This can be accessed through `Window > General > Test Runner`.
